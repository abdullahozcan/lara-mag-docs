## Install on hosting

> {note} It's better if you install it locally and make it ready for your website before deploying on your hosting.

- Run `composer install` to install vendor packages (If you're not a Laravel developer and you can't run that command, please contact me https://codecanyon.net/user/botble then I will send you that folder).

- Upload all files into `public_html`.
- Create a database and import data from `database.sql` (it's located in source code).
- Create `.env` from `.env.example` and update your database information
- Config for media:
    + If your hosting support SSH, you just need to cd to `public_html` and run command `php artisan storage:link`
    + If your hosting doesn't support SSH. You have to open file `config/filesystem.php`
                                           
       Then change
       
       ```php
       'public' => [
           'driver' => 'local',
           'root' => storage_path('app/public'),
           'url' => env('APP_URL').'/storage',
           'visibility' => 'public',
       ],
       ```
       
       to
       
       ```php
       'public' => [
           'driver' => 'local',
           'root' => public_path('storage'),
           'url' => env('APP_URL').'/storage',
           'visibility' => 'public',
       ],
       ```
      
       Copy all files from `/storage/app/public` to `public/storage`.


## Install locally or in VPS

* Run `composer install` to download vendor packages

* Create `.env` file from `.env-example` and update your configuration

* Run `php artisan migrate` to create database structure with no sample data or import default database from `database.sql` if you need sample data.

* Run `php artisan cms:user:create` to create admin user

* Run `php artisan vendor:publish --tag=cms-public --force`

* Run `php artisan cms:theme:activate lara-mag`

* Run `php artisan cms:theme:assets:publish`

* Run `php artisan storage:link`

Note: If you can't run `php artisan storage:link` (some hosting doesn't support it), you can change config
in `/config/filesystems.php` like this https://prnt.sc/pn50dc then move all uploaded file from `/storage/app/public` to `/public/storage`.

* Run the first test with command `php artisan serve`. Open `http://localhost:8000`, you should see home page of Botble CMS


**If you need sample data, you can import it from `database.sql`**

**LaraMag should run on a virtual host. Create a virtual host like cms.local to run LaraMag. Follow these steps to see how to config virtual host: [Setup virtual host](/lara-mag/3.5/virtualhost).**

## Note

This site can only be run at domain name, not folder link.

On your localhost, setting virtual host. Something like `http://lara-mag.local` is ok.

Cannot use as `http://localhost/lara-mag/...`.

Please remove `public` in your domain also, you can point your domain to `public` folder

or use `.httaccess` (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23837933/how-can-i-remove-public-index-php-in-the-url-generated-laravel)

Follow these steps to see how to config virtual host: [Setup virtual host](/cms/4.0/virtualhost).

Well done! Now, you can login to the dashboard by access to your_domain_site/admin.
